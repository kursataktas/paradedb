title: Postgres Extensions
---

ParadeDB is built from two Postgres extensions

- The `pg_search` extension powers all of ParadeDB's [full text search API](/documentation).
- The `pg_analytics` extension powers ParadeDB's [integrations](/integrations).

This guide explains how to install these extensions inside an existing, self-hosted Postgres database.

# Prerequisites

Ensure that you have superuser access to the Postgres database.

Next, install `libicu`.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu70
```

```bash Ubuntu 24.04
sudo apt-get install -y libicu74
```

</CodeGroup>

# Install the ParadeDB Postgres Extensions

ParadeDB provides prebuilt binaries for our extensions on

- Debian 12
- Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9

Postgres 14, 15, 16, and 17 on both `amd64 (x86_64)` and `arm64` are available. If you are using a different version of Postgres or a different operating system, you will need to build the extensions from source.

### pg_search

The prebuilt releases can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/latest).

<Note>
  You can replace `0.11.1` with the `pg_search` version you wish to install and
  `17` with the version of Postgres you are using.

### pg_analytics

The prebuilt releases can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/paradedb/pg_analytics/releases/latest).

<Note>
  You can replace `0.2.2` with the `pg_analytics` version you wish to install
  and `17` with the version of Postgres you are using.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Ubuntu 24.04
# Available arch versions are amd64, arm64
curl -L "https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/releases/download/v0.2.1/postgresql-17-pg-analytics_0.2.1-1PARADEDB-noble_amd64.deb" -o /tmp/pg_analytics.deb
sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb

sudo apt-get install -y /tmp/*.deb
```

```bash Debian 12

sudo dnf install -y /tmp/*.rpm
```

</CodeGroup>

# Update `postgresql.conf`

Next, add the extension(s) to `shared_preload_libraries` in `postgresql.conf`.

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_search,pg_analytics'
```

Reload the Postgres server for these changes to take effect.

# Load the Extensions

Finally, connect to your Postgres database via your client of choice (e.g. `psql`) and run the following command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_search;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_analytics;
```

That's it! To get started, follow the [quickstart guide](/documentation/getting-started/quickstart).

<Note>
  `pg_search` can be combined with `pgvector` for hybrid search. You can find
  the instructions for installing `pgvector`
  [here](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
