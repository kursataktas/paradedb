title: Fuzzy Phrase
---

## Basic Usage

`fuzzy_phrase` is like `fuzzy_term` but for query phrases that are comprised of multiple tokens.
Unlike a typical phrase query, `fuzzy_phrase` finds documents that are a fuzzy match against **any one** of the query tokens.

```sql Function Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@ paradedb.fuzzy_phrase('description', 'ruining shoez');
```
```sql JSON Syntax
SELECT description, rating, category
FROM mock_items
WHERE id @@@
'{
    "fuzzy_phrase": {
        "field": "description",
        "value": "ruining shoez"
    }
}'::jsonb;
```

<ParamField body="field" required>
  Specifies the field within the document to search for the term.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="value" required>
  Defines the phrase you are searching for within the specified field. This
  phrase is automatically tokenized in the same way as `field`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="distance" default={2}>
  The maximum Levenshtein distance (i.e. single character edits) allowed to
  consider a term in the index as a match for the query term. Maximum value is
  `2`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="transpose_cost_one" default={true}>
  When set to `true`, transpositions (swapping two adjacent characters) as a
  single edit in the Levenshtein distance calculation, while `false` considers
  it two separate edits (a deletion and an insertion).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="prefix" default={false}>
  When set to `true`, the initial substring (prefix) of the query term is
  exempted from the fuzzy edit distance calculation, while false includes the
  entire string in the calculation.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="match_all_terms" default={false}>
  When set to `true`, **all** tokens of the query have to match in order for a
  document to be considered a match.
</ParamField>

Setting `match_all_terms` to `true` makes it so that **all** query tokens must
match in order for a document to be considered a match.
